### PASTEL HUES 1.0
	
Pastel Hues is a simple extension that can add some much needed color to your google searches. While this extension can potentially work on some other sites, google was the intended site for this functionality. 

With the use of this extension the user is offered a choice between 4 colors: Lavender, Mint, Sky, and Rose, which can be toggled with the use of a pop up. The user can also switch back to the default white if needed. In making this extension, i was inspired by my love of soft pastel-esque colors and how when they are applied in the context of the web, can be instnatly gratifying. I hope you enjoy the subtle pastel tones while browsing the web (:
